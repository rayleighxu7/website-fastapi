My logo was designed to convey several ideas. The three lines, which progressively shorten, form an “F” to represent my work as a freelancer. The filter-inspired shape reflects my focus on elevating raw data through careful cleaning and refinement. In addition, the three lines symbolise the three core stages of data engineering - ETL: Extract, Transform, and Load. Viewed from the side, the logo can also be interpreted as a bar chart, reinforcing the theme of data and analytics. Finally, the gold color reflects the premium, high-quality standard I bring to every project. Is it over-engineering and over thought? Probably, but doesn't change the fact that I love it.
